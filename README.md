# CPlusPlus-STL-Implementation

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/C++-17-success)

## Introduction 
These are the implementations from scratch for the data structures/containers in the C++ Standard Template Library (STL), which can be found [here](https://cplusplus.com/reference/stl/). In addition, I also performed HugeInteger arithmetic operations using the containers I implemented. 

## Getting Started:
### Materials Overview 
1. For every container, there will be a `.pptx` and a `.docx` file for explaination. 
2. The `.h` files are the axiliary header for the corresponding `.cpp` files.
3. My implementation for the containers are at the `.sln` file inside the `1081517-hwX` folders. 
4. There will also be an empty `.cpp` file, e.g. ***Assignment 1.cpp*** for your own practice. 


### Usage - for Visual Studio
1. Clone this github repo. 
```
git clone https://github.com/Joannechiao18/CPlusPlus-STL-Implementation.git
```
2. Please `cd` to the `container directory` you like, then `cd` to the `1081517-hwX` folder.
3. Run the `.sln` solution file through Visual Studio.
